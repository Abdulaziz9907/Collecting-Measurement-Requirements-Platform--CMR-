# CMR React Frontend

This folder contains a React-based frontend application for the Collecting Measurement Requirements (CMR) platform.

The application was bootstrapped manually due to environment restrictions. Run
`npm install` once to fetch the required dependencies. After the installation
completes you can start the development server with `npm start` (or
`npx react-scripts start` if the command is not recognized).
